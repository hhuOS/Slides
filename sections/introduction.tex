	\begin{frame}{Facts about hhuOS}
	\begin{itemize}
		\setlength\itemsep{1em}
		\item A small operating system for teaching and learning purposes
		\item written for x86 32-bit architecture
		\item written in C++ and x86-Assembler using gcc and nasm
		\item Open-Source, published under the GPL v3 license
		\item $\sim43000$ lines of code
	\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}
	
	\begin{frame}{hhuOS - Features}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Processes \& Threads
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Round-Robin based preemptive scheduling
				\item Binary files are executed as processes
				\item Each process has its own address space
			\end{itemize}
			\pause
			\item Adress spaces and memory management
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Using x86-Paging mechanism (virtual/physical memory)
				\item Lazy mapping implementation
				\item Kernel address space is always mapped at 3 GiB (not accessible from user space)
				\item Different memory managing algorithms are implemented (Free List, Bitmap, Table)
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}

	\begin{frame}{hhuOS - Features}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Unified Library
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Single codebase for user- and kernel-space library
				\item Functions requiring kernel access are outsourced into an interface (implemented two times - for kernel and user space)
				\item Kernel access from user space via system calls (software interrupts)
			\end{itemize}
			\pause
			\item Further features
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Virtual Filesystem (can mount physical filesystems)
				\item Hardware support
					\begin{itemize}
						\item Basic I/O: Keyboard \& Mouse, Serial \& Parallel Ports, VESA \& CGA graphics, PCI \& ISA bus, PC Speaker
						\item Interrupt: Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC), APIC
						\item Time: Programmable Interval Timer Real Time Clock
						\item Storage: Floppy, IDE
						\item Network: Realtek RTL8139 (bachelor thesis by Alexander Hansen)
					\end{itemize}
				\item Multiboot compatible: Bootable on UEFI and BIOS systems
				\item Own UEFI bootloader (towboot, developed by Niklas Sombert)
				\item UDP/IP-stack (based on bachelor thesis by Hannes Feil)
			\end{itemize}
