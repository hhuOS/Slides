		\item Timer invokes scheduler every 10ms to switch to next process (and address space)
		\item Each process has a separate thread scheduler, switching the current thread each time the process becomes active
		\item Threads can be blocked and unblocked by other threads
		\item Threads can sleep for a defined time
		\item It is possible to join other threads (or processes)
